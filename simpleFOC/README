Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

# SimpleFOC Robot Firmware for ST disco_b_g431b_esc1

This firmware runs on the disco_b_g431b_esc1 eval board ESC.

It takes a velocity command over CAN and writes the appropriate target velocity to the motor.

Velocity message format

[CAN_ID=123][vel_1_lsb, vel_1_msb, vel_2_lsb, vel_2_msb, vel_3_lsb, vel_3_msb, vel_4_lsb, vel_4_msb]

Each velocity is a 16bit 2-decimal fixed point value in rad/s. 

So a velocity of 10 rad/s would be 10 * 100 = 1000 = 0x3E8 = [0xE8, 0x03] as the over the wire format
